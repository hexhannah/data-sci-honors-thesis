This repository is for Hannah Brown's Data Science Honors Thesis at UC Berkeley[Pre-Analysis Plan](notebooks/pre-analysis-plan.ipynb).

## Directory Structure

This repo contains a few subfolders which contain the elements of this project.

| Folder | Description |
|-----|-----|
| `data`  | data from the original analysis in CSV, TSV, and pip-separated format  |
| `images`  | image files used in the Jupyter Notebooks  |
| `notebooks`  | Jupyter Notebook files, including reproduction analysis using both `pandas` and `datascience`, as well as the Pre-Analysis Plan and a "blank" notebook  |
| `output`  | output data (same as original, for demo purposes) in CSV and TSV format  |
| `subassignments`  | Markdown files with submissions for final project sub-assignments  |


### MyBinder

You should note that this repository has a MyBinder link (at the top of this README) which links to MyBinder to allow others to run our code. _Your repository should also include such a link._ The steps to create this link are given below:

1. Copy the `requirements.txt` file from this repo and add it to yours. This should cover all dependencies, but if you use any that are not listed in that file, _make sure to add them_.
2. Go to the [MyBinder website](https://mybinder.org/) and paste the URL to your repo in the `GitHub repository name or URL` field (pictured below).
3. Include the brach name in the `Git branch, tag, or commit` field; for most, this will be `master`.
4. Open the dropdown below the Binder URL and copy the text next to the ![Markdown logo](images/markdown.png).
5. Paste this text into your README right below where your names are listed at the top. For our repo, it looked like this:

```markdown
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ls88-openscienceconnector/final-project/master)
```

Here is a screenshot of the website filled out for this repo:

### Github Best Practices

Note that this repository has a README and that each subfolder (except for the `images` folder) has a README as well. This should be reflected in the repo that you submit.

Make sure that your files render properly in Github. For example, Github does not render the LaTeX `\limits` command, and any display math that uses it will not be rendered.

**License:** This repository has a CC0 license on it.

### Deliverables

Your project should have some deliverable (e.g. PDF, PPT, data). These should be uploaded in the `output` folder of your repo. If it is not a file you can upload (e.g. a Google Slides presentation), it should be linked-to in the README for that folder (even if this means you have a folder that is empty except for a README).
